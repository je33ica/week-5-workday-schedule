# week-5-workday-schedule
A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day

The time and date are displayed and updated dynamically

Time blocks are colour coded; past, present & future and update dynamically

Users input is saved in local storage, the local storage is cleared after the work day is finished ready for the next day 

My aim was to keep the code as readable as possible whilst being succint
